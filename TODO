General:

- Can code be simplified?
- Fix all GitHub issues
- Separate tests in various files?
- Indicate in README.md which MIDI specification is implemented
- Add alias for vel_note-on called velocity?

To reach MIDI 1.0 Specification:

- Add midi-event: channel-aftertouch
- Rename ｢aftertouch｣ to ｢note-aftertouch｣
- Add all types of SysEx-events
- Add meta-events:
    - Sequencer number
    - SMPTE offset
    - Key signature
    - M-Live Tag (Not standard, but supported by MidiKit and QMidi)?
- Question: Is it clear that program is for the program-name?
